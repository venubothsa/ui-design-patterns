# UI DESIGN PATTERN

User interface (UI) design patterns are reusable/recurring components which designers use to solve common problems in user interface design. For example, the breadcrumbs design pattern lets users retrace their steps. Designers can apply them to a broad range of cases, but must adapt each to the specific context of use.

### Why we use Design Pattern :

Websites and apps have a conventional look and feel because of design patterns such as global navigation and tab bars. In UI design, you can use design patterns as a quick way to build interfaces that solve a problem—for instance, a date picker design pattern to let users quickly pick a date in a form. So, UI design patterns serve as design blueprints that allow designers to choose the best and commonly used interfaces for the specific context the user faces. Each pattern typically contains:

* A user’s usability-related problem.
* The context/situation where that problem happens.
* The principle involved—e.g., error management.
* The proven solution for the designer to implement to address the core of the     problem.
* Why—the reason for the pattern’s existence and how it can affect usability.
Examples—which show the pattern’s successful real-life application (e.g., screenshots and descriptions).
* Implementation—some patterns include detailed instructions.

# WYSIWYG
